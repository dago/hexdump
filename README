				HEXDUMP
		(by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>)

Yes, it's yet another hex dumper.  This one produces a nice CP/M-like
format by default and can do EBCDIC.  It's internationalized, too.
Has many useful formatting functions.

This hex dumper was born because

	a) od octal format is appallingly ugly
	b) od -x ain't much better
	c) I needed to dump EBCDIC files from SNA sessions
	d) I needed to dump single blocks of files offset into the file.

If any of these describes your universe, you'll like it too. The format
resembles a CP/M or MS/DOS DEBUG dump screen. There is nothing UNIX-specific
in the source, it should work OK under any C with a stdio.h library. And,
in fact, I'm told it has been used under Windows NT.

I wrote the original of this in 1983.  I'm not certain, but I think it
may have been my very first C program, and I believe it was the first
code I wrote under Unix (4.1BSD on a Vax).  It's certainly the oldest
piece of C code I wrote that I still have source for.  It has held
up remarkably well.  For many years it was just `hex'.
