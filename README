				HEX 1.1
		(by Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>)

This hex dumper was born because

	a) od octal format is appallingly ugly
	b) od -x ain't much better
	c) I needed to dump EBCDIC files from SNA sessions
	d) I needed to dump single blocks of files

If any of these describes your universe, you'll like it too. The format
resembles a CP/M or MS/DOS DEBUG dump screen. There is nothing UNIX-specific
in the source, it should work OK under any C with a stdio.h library.
