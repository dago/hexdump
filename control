Package: hexdump

Description: Dump binary files in a CP/M-like hex format.
 Yes, it's yet another textual hex dumper for peoplebwho think od -x
 output is ugly.  This one produces a nice CP/M-like format by default
 and can do EBCDIC.  It's internationalized, too.  Has many optional
 formatting functions.
