.TH HEX 1 "Oct 27, 1987"
.SH NAME
hex.c \- dump a file to stdout in CP/M-like hex format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hex [-V] [-w] [-e] [-c] [-g] [-s] [filename...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program provides a facility for obtaining a dump of a binary file
to stdout.  The default format is a CP/M style hex dump with byte
offset in file, 16 bytes of hex and 16 bytes of alpha representation
with '.' for non-printables per line. If no filename is given, hex
reads from standard input.
.PP
The program accepts the following options to control its output:
.TP 10
-w -- set # of bytes dumped per line (default is 16)
.TP 10
-e -- display EBCDIC character assignments rather than ASCII
.TP 10
-c -- display printable characters as text in-line
.TP 10
-g -- don't output mid-page gutter
.TP 10
-s -- dump file section
.TP 10
-V -- print version number and exit
.PP
The command line is scanned left-to-right for filenames and options, and
each file dumped according to the format defined by preceding options. To
turn off an option, precede the letter with a +. Options that take arguments
may have them immediately following the option letter or whitespace-separated.
.PP
If the command-line arguments include two or more filenames (with -
being regarded as a `filename' for standard input), hex will emit a
one-line header giving the name the file in front of each input file.
.PP
The -s option expects a start offset, optionally followed by a
comma-separated count. Each of these should be a decimal or hex integer
(hex must be prefixed by x or h; leading zeros will be ignored).
.PP
The -w option expects a width, formatted as a single decimal or hex number
in the style of an -s option argument. Odd widths turn on the -g option.
.SH NOTE
The definition of EBCDIC used is IBM's ASCII-compatible 96-character
SCS set used with Systems Network Architecture (SNA).
